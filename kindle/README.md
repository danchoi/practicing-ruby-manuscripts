## A Kindle edition generator for Practicing Ruby

The generate.rb script will generate a Kindle-compatible MOBI document that
you can copy to your Kindle's document folder or send to your Kindle email
address  and then read on your Kindle. 

To run generate.rb, please first install the `kindlerb` gem and the
`kindlegen` binary. Instructions are
[here](https://github.com/danchoi/kindlerb).

Then from this `kindle` subdirectory, run this command:

    ruby generate.rb

You should see some output, and then see a file generated called something like `practicing-ruby-2012-12-26.mobi`. Transfer this file to your Kindle.
